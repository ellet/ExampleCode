we wanted something rewarding when enemies died so i created score and health pickups that burst out of enemies when they die, when they collide with a wall or the ground they activate a seek radius when the player is inside out its seeks radius it will start flying towards the player. to do this a callback is used when 

what i like about it:
easy to add new pickup types



what i would have done different today.
instead of a callback i should have used a gameobject event (I previosly made a event system where a message gets broadcasted to components on a gameobject that are listening for that message).

I used our collision system for checking of the pickup was in contact with the player which might be a bit overkill compared to just distance checking against the player.
but using the collision system meant you could quite easily change the pickups to be picked up npc's or other players.

the collider for sensing when to start seeking towards the play is on a seperate gameobject because i added being able to differentiate between what colliders were triggered in a collision event at a later stage after this feature was finished.
